The non-parametric local constant estimation code is the answer to question 2, Problem Set 2, ECON 883-06 of Duke University (2020 F, Instructor: Federico Bugni). Data source is attatched.

The .m file implements the estimation using a second-order Gaussian kernel functions and the following bandwidths: rule-of-thumb, cross-validation, and Akaike information criterion. Asymptotically valid confidence interval is also obtained.
